# fmcli
Console client to add/edit/delete objects to a Cisco/Sourcefire Firewall Management Center (FMC)

For the unfortunate souls who have to be working on FTD...

-- List of FMC feature currently working 

* Adding a network object (host or subnet)
* Adding a network group (can contain only litteral hosts or subnets)

-- List of FMC features that will work later

* Adding a FQDN as a network object 
* Adding a dynamic network group
* Adding a dynamic network host/subnet

-- List of FMC features that may be added later

* Browsing of object list
* Allowing the application to use an existing object instead of creating a new one when the host/subnet/fqdn/group already exist

-- List of misc stuff that I plan to add 

* config file to store credential, FMC URL and some other options
